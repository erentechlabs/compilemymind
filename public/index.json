In-place modification: Useful when you want to save memory. Common interview question: Appears often in technical screenings. Problem Overview #\rWe are given:\nAn integer array nums, sorted in non-decreasing order. We need to: Remove duplicates so that each unique element appears only once. Keep the relative order of elements the same. Modify the array in-place without creating another array. Return k, the number of unique elements. The values beyond index k-1 don‚Äôt matter.\nExample #\rint[] nums = {0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4}; Output\nk = 5\nThe array nums is modified to:\n[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, _, _, _, _, _]\nThe underscores mean that the values at those indices are irrelevant after processing.\nThought Process #\rBecause the array is already sorted:\nAll duplicates will be next to each other. This makes it easy to detect duplicates by comparing the current element with the previous one. We can:\nUse a pointer k to track where the next unique element should go. Iterate through the array starting from index 1. If the current element is different from the previous one, put it at index k and increment k. Step-by-Step Flow #\rImagine nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]:\nStart with k = 1 (because the first element is always unique). Move through the array with index i: If nums[i] != nums[i - 1], it‚Äôs a new number ‚Üí put it at nums[k], then k++. At the end, k tells us how many unique numbers there are. Complexity #\rTime Complexity: O(n) ‚Üí We scan the array once. Space Complexity: O(1) ‚Üí No extra array, we modify in-place. Final Code #\rpublic static int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) { int k = 1; for (int i = 1; i \u0026lt; nums.length; i++) { if (nums[i] != nums[i - 1]) { nums[k] = nums[i]; k++; } } return k; } ","date":"9 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/","section":"Posts","summary":"\u003cp\u003eRemoving duplicates from a sorted array is a common coding interview question.\u003cbr\u003e\nIt‚Äôs simple at first glance, but it‚Äôs also a great way to learn \u003cstrong\u003ein-place array manipulation\u003c/strong\u003e and the \u003cstrong\u003etwo-pointer pattern\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array ‚Äî The Two-Pointer Solution","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"9 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"9 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/technology/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Technology","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"9 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/two-pointers/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Two Pointers","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"7 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/architecture/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Architecture","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"7 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/best-practices/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Best Practices","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"7 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/software-development/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Software Development","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"7 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/spring-boot/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Spring Boot","type":"tags"},{"content":"Java is truly an amazing programming language. And among its rich toolkit, Spring Boot definitely stands out as a powerful building block. With Spring Boot, we build fast, effective, and sustainable applications. In this article, we‚Äôll take a closer look at the core layers of Spring Boot: Controller, Service, and Repository annotations.\nWhy Layered Architecture? #\rBefore jumping in, let‚Äôs quickly understand why layered architecture matters:\nSeparation of concerns: Makes code easier to read and maintain. Testability: Each layer can be tested independently. Reusability: Business logic can be reused in different parts. Scalability: Easier to extend and modify. Controller #\rController is the layer that handles incoming HTTP requests. It listens to what the client asks for and directs the request to the appropriate handler. When building REST APIs, we usually use @RestController which automatically returns JSON or XML responses.\nWe handle HTTP requests using @RequestMapping or its shortcuts like @GetMapping, @PostMapping, @PutMapping, and @DeleteMapping.\n@RestController @RequestMapping(\u0026#34;/api/users\u0026#34;) public class UserController { @Autowired UserService userService; @GetMapping(\u0026#34;/{id}\u0026#34;) public ResponseEntity\u0026lt;UserDto\u0026gt; getUser(@PathVariable Long id) { UserDto user = userService.getUserById(id); return ResponseEntity.ok(user); } @PostMapping public ResponseEntity\u0026lt;UserDto\u0026gt; createUser(@RequestBody UserDto userDto) { UserDto createdUser = userService.createUser(userDto); return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.CREATED).body(createdUser); } } Service #\rThe Service layer is where the business logic lives. Data coming from the controller is processed here ‚Äî validations, calculations, and any rules specific to the domain are handled in this layer. It‚Äôs the brain of the application.\nMarking a class with @Service lets Spring recognize it as a service component and automatically inject it where needed.\n@Service public class UserService { @Autowired UserRepository userRepository; public UserDto getUserById(Long id) { User user = userRepository.findById(id) .orElseThrow(() -\u0026gt; new EntityNotFoundException(\u0026#34;User not found\u0026#34;)); return convertToDto(user); } public UserDto createUser(UserDto userDto) { User user = convertToEntity(userDto); User savedUser = userRepository.save(user); return convertToDto(savedUser); } } Repository #\rRepository is the data access layer, responsible for communicating with the database. Usually defined as an interface extending Spring Data interfaces like JpaRepository or CrudRepository.\nCrudRepository provides basic CRUD operations. JpaRepository extends CrudRepository and also offers pagination and sorting support. You can also write custom queries using the @Query annotation when standard methods aren‚Äôt enough.\n@Repository public interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository\u0026lt;User, Long\u0026gt; { List\u0026lt;User\u0026gt; findByLastName(String lastName); @Query(\u0026#34;SELECT u FROM User u WHERE u.email = :email\u0026#34;) Optional\u0026lt;User\u0026gt; findByEmail(@Param(\u0026#34;email\u0026#34;) String email); } How These Layers Work Together #\rA typical request flow goes like this:\nClient sends an HTTP request. Controller receives the request and extracts data. Controller calls the Service layer. Service processes the business logic and calls the Repository layer. Repository interacts with the database. Service returns processed data back to the Controller. Controller sends the response to the client. Summary #\rLayer Responsibility Annotations Example Interfaces Controller Handles HTTP requests \u0026amp; routing @RestController - Service Implements business logic @Service - Repository Manages data access @Repository JpaRepository, CrudRepository Conclusion #\rUsing layered architecture with Controller, Service, and Repository in Spring Boot helps you write code that is clean, testable, and maintainable.

What I want to talk about today definitely falls into the fun category. üòä\nImagine we only have the characters (), {}, and [] to work with. We want to check whether every opening parenthesis, square bracket, and curly brace is correctly closed in the given string.\nFor example, inputs like () or ({[]}) are valid, while something like ()[]{}{ would be invalid because of the unclosed brace at the end.\nThere are several ways to solve this, but today I‚Äôll walk you through a method that uses a data structure called a Stack.\nQuick Refresher: What is a Stack? #\rA Stack is a data structure that stores items in a last-in, first-out (LIFO) manner. Think of it like a stack of plates‚Äîwhat goes in last comes out first. Here\u0026rsquo;s a simple visual to imagine it: Now let‚Äôs apply this to our parentheses validation problem.\nStep-by-Step Solution #\rWe will write a method that takes a string input, such as \u0026ldquo;()[]{}\u0026rdquo;, and returns true if the parentheses are valid, or false if they‚Äôre not.\n1. Define the Method #\rpublic static boolean isValid(String s) The input s will be a string like \u0026ldquo;()[]{}\u0026rdquo;. We return a boolean indicating whether the parentheses are valid.\n2. Declare a Stack #\rWe‚Äôll use a Stack to keep track of opening brackets:\nStack\u0026lt;Character\u0026gt; stack = new Stack\u0026lt;\u0026gt;(); 3. Iterate Through the Characters #\rWe loop through each character in the string:\nfor (char c : s.toCharArray()) 4. Push Opening Brackets onto the Stack #\rIf we encounter an opening bracket, we push it onto the stack:\nif (c == \u0026#39;(\u0026#39; || c == \u0026#39;[\u0026#39; || c == \u0026#39;{\u0026#39;) { stack.push(c); } 5. Handle Closing Brackets #\rIf we encounter a closing bracket, we first check if the stack is empty. If it is, that means there was no corresponding opening bracket, so we return false.\nThen, we look at the top of the stack using peek() (without removing it) to check if it matches the closing bracket. If it doesn‚Äôt match, we return false. If it does, we remove the top of the stack using pop():\nelse { if (stack.isEmpty()) return false; char top = stack.peek(); if ((c == \u0026#39;)\u0026#39; \u0026amp;\u0026amp; top != \u0026#39;(\u0026#39;) || (c == \u0026#39;]\u0026#39; \u0026amp;\u0026amp; top != \u0026#39;[\u0026#39;) || (c == \u0026#39;}\u0026#39; \u0026amp;\u0026amp; top != \u0026#39;{\u0026#39;)) { return false; } stack.pop(); } 6. Final Validation #\rIf the stack is empty at the end, that means all opening brackets had matching closing brackets. Otherwise, some were left unmatched.\nreturn stack.isEmpty(); Summary #\rHere‚Äôs the complete method:\npublic static boolean isValid(String s) { Stack\u0026lt;Character\u0026gt; stack = new Stack\u0026lt;\u0026gt;(); for (char c : s.toCharArray()) { if (c == \u0026#39;(\u0026#39; || c == \u0026#39;[\u0026#39; || c == \u0026#39;{\u0026#39;) { stack.push(c); } else { if (stack.isEmpty()) return false; char top = stack.peek(); if ((c == \u0026#39;)\u0026#39; \u0026amp;\u0026amp; top != \u0026#39;(\u0026#39;) || (c == \u0026#39;]\u0026#39; \u0026amp;\u0026amp; top != \u0026#39;[\u0026#39;) || (c == \u0026#39;}\u0026#39; \u0026amp;\u0026amp; top != \u0026#39;{\u0026#39;)) { return false; } stack.pop(); } } return stack.isEmpty(); } ","date":"6 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/how-to-solve-leetcode-valid-parentheses-using-stack-in-java/","section":"Posts","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLeetCode problems can sometimes be frustrating, but other times they can be genuinely fun.

Let‚Äôs explore their differences with examples and best practices.\nWhat is @Component? #\r@Component is a class-level annotation that tells Spring to automatically detect and register the class as a bean during component scanning.\nimport org.springframework.stereotype.Component; @Component public class MyService { public void doSomething() { System.out.println(\u0026#34;Component-based service is working!\u0026#34;); } } üîç Note: Annotations like @Service, @Repository, and @Controller are specializations of @Component.

Despite their similarities, they have distinct differences that set them apart in terms of syntax, platform compatibility, performance, and ecosystem. This article will provide an in-depth comparison of Java and C# to help you decide which one is best for your next project.\nOverview #\rC#, developed by Microsoft in 2000 as part of the .NET framework, was initially a Windows-based language. Over time, with the advent of .NET, C# has become a cross-platform language, supporting Windows, Linux, and macOS.\nJava was created by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle) in the mid-1990s, with a primary focus on portability and cross-platform compatibility. It is widely used in enterprise environments, web applications, and Android development.\nSimilarities Between C# and Java #\rObject-Oriented: Both Java and C# are purely object-oriented languages, following OOP principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Garbage Collection: Both languages have automatic memory management via garbage collection, which helps avoid memory leaks by reclaiming unused memory. Cross-Platform Support: Although Java traditionally offered the advantage of \u0026ldquo;Write Once, Run Anywhere\u0026rdquo; with the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), C# has also become a cross-platform language with .NET, now known as .NET 9/10. Multithreading: Both Java and C# have robust support for multithreading and concurrent programming, making it easier to build high-performance applications. Key Differences Between C# vs Java #\r1. Platform Independence #\rC#: C# was initially confined to the Windows platform using the .NET Framework. However, .NET (now .NET 9/10) allows C# to run on multiple platforms, including Linux and macOS, making it a viable choice for cross-platform development.\nJava: Java is well-known for its platform independence. Java code is compiled to bytecode, which can be executed on any platform with a JVM, enabling it to run on Windows, Linux, macOS, and other systems without modification.\n2. Syntax and Features #\rC#: C# has more modern features, such as properties, events, delegates, and LINQ (Language Integrated Query). It supports more advanced constructs, including async/await for asynchronous programming. This makes C# a more feature-rich and flexible language.\nJava: Java‚Äôs syntax is slightly more verbose compared to C#. Java uses exceptions and error handling mechanisms such as try-catch blocks, and it does not have built-in support for properties, delegates, or events.\n3. Performance #\rC#: C# tends to have faster startup times and slightly better raw performance due to its compilation to Intermediate Language (IL), which is executed by the Common Language Runtime (CLR). C# has more direct access to Windows APIs and can be more optimized for desktop applications.\nJava: Java is slower in terms of startup time, but its performance improves over time thanks to Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation by the JVM. Java is often considered a bit slower compared to C# in terms of execution speed but can be highly optimized for server-side applications.\n4. Ecosystem and Frameworks #\rC#: C# is closely tied to the .NET Framework and the .NET ecosystem. It supports ASP.NET for web development, WinUI and WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) for desktop applications, and .NET MAUI for mobile development. The .NET ecosystem continues to grow, and C# is gaining traction in areas like cloud computing and cross-platform apps.\nJava: Java has a vast ecosystem, especially for enterprise applications, Android development, and big data platforms. Popular frameworks like Spring (for web development) and Hibernate (for ORM) are widely used in the Java world.\n5. Development Tools #\rC#: C# developers primarily use Microsoft Visual Studio, one of the most feature-rich IDEs available. Visual Studio offers robust debugging tools, IntelliSense, and integrates seamlessly with Azure, SQL Server, and other Microsoft products.\nJava: Java developers typically use IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans for development. These IDEs offer rich features and plugins for Java development, including debugging, code completion, and refactoring tools.\n6. Use Cases #\rC#:\nWindows Applications: C# is the language of choice for desktop applications on Windows, particularly using **WinUI\u0026quot;, WPF and WinForms. Web Development: ASP.NET is a robust framework for web development with C#, used for building scalable and high-performance web applications. Game Development: C# is widely used in game development, particularly with the Unity engine. Cross-Platform Development: C# with .NET MAUI allows for the creation of cross-platform mobile applications. Java:\nEnterprise Applications: Java is highly favored in large-scale enterprise environments, especially in finance, government, and healthcare sectors. Android Development: Java was the primary language for Android app development (though Kotlin has become more popular in recent years). Big Data: Java is heavily used in big data technologies like Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark. Cloud Computing: Java is widely used in cloud-based applications, particularly in Amazon Web Services (AWS). 7. Community and Job Market #\rC#: C# is widely used within the Microsoft ecosystem and is also increasingly popular in the gaming industry due to Unity. The rise of .NET has made C# a strong candidate for cloud-based applications and cross-platform development, making C# developers highly sought after, particularly in game development and enterprise application development.\nJava: Java has a massive and mature community, with a strong presence in enterprise applications, Android development, and backend systems. There is always high demand for Java developers, especially for roles in enterprise environments, big data, and cloud computing.\nConclusion #\rBoth C# and Java are powerful, versatile languages that have stood the test of time. The choice between Java and C# largely depends on the platform, the type of application, and the development tools you prefer.\nIf you are working with the Microsoft tech stack, developing for Windows desktop apps, or interested in game development with Unity, C# would be ideal. If you are developing for cross-platform environments, need portability, or are working with Android, Java is a strong choice. Ultimately, both languages offer robust features, strong communities, and solid performance. Understanding their strengths and weaknesses will help you decide which is best suited for your specific project.\n","date":"28 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/csharp-vs-java/","section":"Posts","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWhen it comes to object-oriented programming languages, \u003cstrong\u003eC#\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eJava\u003c/strong\u003e are two of the most widely used and highly regarded languages in the software development world.

It requires writing a lot more code, has many rules, and you often need to add extra libraries for things that come built-in with other languages. On top of that, Oracle‚Äôs history with licensing lawsuits has given Java a bad reputation among many developers. But despite all that, I still like Java more. I know its flaws, but its strengths mean more to me. Below, I want to explain why ‚Äî with some practical reasons.\n1. Static Typing ‚Äì Catching Errors Early #\rIn Java, you have to declare variable types explicitly before using them. It may feel like a hassle at first, but in big projects, it really helps.\nFor example, in Python, you can define a function that adds two values, but if you accidentally pass a string and a number, it will crash at runtime. Java, on the other hand, catches this kind of mistake before the program even runs. This difference can save a lot of debugging time in complex systems.\n2. Performance ‚Äì Safer for Long-Running Tasks #\rJava runs on the JVM and is much faster than Python. This matters in large-scale data processing, server-side applications, or services that run continuously.\nFor instance, reading and processing millions of log entries usually completes faster and more efficiently in Java than in Python.\n3. C-Style Syntax ‚Äì Feeling More Disciplined While Coding #\rSome developers find Java‚Äôs syntax ‚Äî with curly braces, semicolons, and keywords like public static void ‚Äî overly verbose. But I find this structure helpful. It forces discipline and makes the code more predictable, especially in large teams or enterprise environments.\n4. OOP ‚Äì Breaking Down Software into Pieces #\rJava takes object-oriented programming seriously. It encourages you to define proper classes, methods, constructors, and access controls. This can feel tedious in small scripts but becomes essential in larger applications.\nIn contrast, while Python supports OOP, it allows looser structure, which can lead to messier codebases over time.\n5. Spring and Ecosystem ‚Äì Building Large Systems with Ready Solutions #\rJava‚Äôs Spring Framework provides everything you need to build robust, secure, and scalable enterprise applications ‚Äî from REST APIs to microservices and database integration. Python has powerful frameworks too, like Django and Flask, but Spring is more mature and widely adopted in large corporations.\n6. IDE and Auto-Completion #\rThanks to static typing and a clear structure, Java works beautifully with modern IDEs like IntelliJ IDEA. Auto-completion, real-time error detection, and refactoring tools are extremely accurate.\nWith Python, dynamic typing often makes IDE features less reliable. Sometimes the IDE can‚Äôt even guess what attribute comes after a dot.\n7. Testing Culture ‚Äì Standing Behind Your Code #\rJava has a strong testing culture. Using tools like JUnit, writing unit tests is straightforward and considered best practice. Most serious Java projects include tests from day one.\nPython supports testing too, but in many cases ‚Äî especially in smaller teams ‚Äî it tends to be more optional than enforced.\n8. Backward Compatibility #\rOne of Java‚Äôs most underrated strengths is its commitment to backward compatibility. Code written 10 or even 20 years ago can often still compile and run on modern JVMs. Compare that to Python\u0026rsquo;s painful transition from version 2 to 3, which broke a lot of older code.\n9. Platform Independence #\rJava lives by the motto: ‚ÄúWrite once, run anywhere.‚Äù Thanks to the JVM, Java applications can run on Windows, Linux, macOS, and even Android with minimal modification. This kind of portability is invaluable for cross-platform development.\n10. The Satisfaction While Coding #\rThis might be subjective, but it matters to me: when I write Java, I feel like I‚Äôm building a solid, durable structure. The strict rules and architectural clarity give me confidence. It feels like engineering, not just scripting.\nWhat About Python? #\rPython is a fantastic language ‚Äî no doubt about it. It‚Äôs great for automation, scripting, data science, AI, and quick prototyping. If speed and simplicity are your top priorities, Python absolutely shines.\nBut for building large, long-term software systems, Java still gives me more reliability and long-term satisfaction.\nFinal Word #\rEvery language has strengths and weaknesses. I happily use Python when it‚Äôs the right tool for the job. But Java aligns better with how I like to build systems: with structure, clarity, and confidence.\nJava doesn‚Äôt always offer the easiest path ‚Äî but it often offers the strongest one.\n","date":"28 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/why-i-like-java-more-than-python/","section":"Posts","summary":"\u003cp\u003eGenerally speaking, Java isn‚Äôt the most beloved language out there.
