      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Nintendo Switch isn‚Äôt just another console. It‚Äôs a bridge between worlds ‚Äî between home and on-the-go, between nostalgia and innovation, between simple fun and deep, immersive adventures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while its hybrid design is impressive, what truly sets it apart is its library. Nintendo‚Äôs first-party games, in particular, are masterclasses in creativity, charm, and craftsmanship.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Removing duplicates from a sorted array is a common coding interview question.&lt;br&gt;
It‚Äôs simple at first glance, but it‚Äôs also a great way to learn &lt;strong&gt;in-place array manipulation&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;two-pointer pattern&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Java is truly an amazing programming language. And among its rich toolkit, Spring Boot definitely stands out as a powerful building block. With Spring Boot, we build fast, effective, and sustainable applications. In this article, we‚Äôll take a closer look at the core layers of Spring Boot: &lt;strong&gt;Controller&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Service&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Repository&lt;/strong&gt; annotations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;LeetCode problems can sometimes be frustrating, but other times they can be genuinely fun. What I want to talk about today definitely falls into the fun category. üòä&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine we only have the characters (), {}, and [] to work with. We want to check whether every opening parenthesis, square bracket, and curly brace is correctly closed in the given string.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Spring Framework provides a powerful &lt;strong&gt;Dependency Injection (DI)&lt;/strong&gt; mechanism to manage application components. In this system, objects are managed by an &lt;strong&gt;IoC (Inversion of Control)&lt;/strong&gt; container. But how do we tell Spring which classes or objects it should manage?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When it comes to object-oriented programming languages, &lt;strong&gt;C#&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Java&lt;/strong&gt; are two of the most widely used and highly regarded languages in the software development world. Despite their similarities, they have distinct differences that set them apart in terms of syntax, platform compatibility, performance, and ecosystem. This article will provide an in-depth comparison of Java and C# to help you decide which one is best for your next project.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why I Like Java More Than Python</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, Java isn‚Äôt the most beloved language out there. It requires writing a lot more code, has many rules, and you often need to add extra libraries for things that come built-in with other languages. On top of that, Oracle‚Äôs history with licensing lawsuits has given Java a bad reputation among many developers. But despite all that, I still like Java more. I know its flaws, but its strengths mean more to me. Below, I want to explain why ‚Äî with some practical reasons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
