## üëã Welcome!

I'm **Eren Karaoƒülu**, the creator and author behind **Compile My Mind** ‚Äî a place where I share my journey, ideas, projects, and thoughts around software development, game creation, and gaming in general.

I‚Äôm a software developer who loves building meaningful, well-structured, and user-focused applications. From designing robust backend systems with **Java Spring**, to crafting sleek mobile interfaces with **Flutter**, building desktop tools with **WPF**, or even developing my own **indie games** ‚Äî I enjoy solving real-world problems through code and creativity.

I also love talking about the games I play, discovering hidden gems, and sharing recommendations based on experience and mood. Whether it's development or just gaming for fun, I'm always looking to learn, grow, and connect with others who share the same passion.
