## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!

Iâ€™m Eren KaraoÄŸlu, the creator of **Compile My Mind** â€” a space where I share my journey, projects, and ideas in software development and technology.  

Iâ€™m passionate about coding, system design, and exploring new technologies. For me, itâ€™s not just about using tools â€” itâ€™s about understanding how they work, building with them, and sharing what I learn along the way.  

What drives me is the excitement of learning, improving, and connecting with people who share the same passion. Through Compile My Mind, I document my growth as a developer and collaborate with like-minded tech enthusiasts.
