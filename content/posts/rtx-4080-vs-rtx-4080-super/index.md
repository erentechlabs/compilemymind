## Final Verdict

The RTX 4080 Super is the better card overall, offering 5-6% more performance at a lower MSRP. However, the decision isn't always straightforward:

### The Winner: RTX 4080 Super

**For new buyers**, the RTX 4080 Super is the clear choice. It's faster, better value, and represents the current generation. The $999 MSRP makes it more palatable than the original RTX 4080's $1,199 launch price.

### When RTX 4080 Makes Sense

If you can find an RTX 4080 for **$900 or less**, it becomes a compelling alternative. The 5-6% performance difference won't be noticeable in most scenarios, and you'll save $100-200.

### Our Recommendation

- **Best Overall**: RTX 4080 Super - Better performance, better value, current-gen
- **Best Value**: RTX 4080 (if under $900) - Nearly identical performance for less money
- **Don't Upgrade**: If you already own an RTX 4080 - Not worth the cost

### The Bottom Line

The RTX 4080 Super is what the RTX 4080 should have been at launch. It offers excellent 4K gaming performance, strong ray tracing capabilities, and DLSS 3 Frame Generation at a more reasonable price point. While the performance improvement over the original is modest, the better value proposition makes it the smarter choice for new builds.

If you already own an RTX 4080, stick with it. The Super isn't a meaningful upgrade. But if you're building new or upgrading from an older card, the RTX 4080 Super is one of the best high-end GPUs you can buy in 2025.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Is the RTX 4080 Super worth $100 more than a discounted RTX 4080?**
A: No, not really. If you can get an RTX 4080 for $900 and the Super costs $1,000+, save your money. The 5-6% performance difference isn't worth $100.

**Q: Will the RTX 4080 Super work with my 650W PSU?**
A: NVIDIA recommends 750W minimum. While it might work with a high-quality 650W PSU, we recommend 750W or higher for stability and headroom.

**Q: Does the RTX 4080 Super support DLSS 3?**
A: Yes, both the RTX 4080 and 4080 Super support DLSS 3 with Frame Generation.

**Q: How much VRAM do I need for 4K gaming?**
A: 16GB is excellent for 4K gaming and should be sufficient for the next 3-4 years. Both cards have 16GB GDDR6X.

**Q: Can these cards handle 4K 144Hz gaming?**
A: Yes, in most games with DLSS enabled. Competitive titles like CS2, Valorant, and Fortnite can hit 144+ FPS at 4K.

**Q: Which brand should I buy?**
A: ASUS TUF, MSI Gaming X Trio, and Gigabyte Gaming OC are all excellent choices. Avoid the cheapest models with poor cooling.

**Q: Is ray tracing playable on these cards?**
A: Absolutely. With DLSS 3, you can enjoy ray tracing at 4K with 60+ FPS in most titles.

**Q: Should I wait for RTX 5080?**
A: If you need a GPU now, buy now. The RTX 5080 likely won't arrive until late 2025 or early 2026.
