The Nintendo Switch isnâ€™t just another console. Itâ€™s a bridge between worlds â€” between home and on-the-go, between nostalgia and innovation, between simple fun and deep, immersive adventures.

And while its hybrid design is impressive, what truly sets it apart is its library. Nintendoâ€™s first-party games, in particular, are masterclasses in creativity, charm, and craftsmanship.

If youâ€™ve recently picked up a Switch â€” or if youâ€™re just looking to rediscover its magic â€” here are 10 essential Nintendo games that capture the heart and soul of the system.

----------

## 1. **The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild**

**A world that breathes.**

Forget everything you thought you knew about open-world games. _Breath of the Wild_ doesnâ€™t just give you freedom â€” it trusts you with it.

There are no checklists forcing you up the mountain. No invisible walls. Just wind, weather, wildlife, and a ruined kingdom begging to be explored.

Climb every peak. Sail across deserts. Cook questionable meals over a campfire.  
This isnâ€™t just a game â€” itâ€™s a place you live in, even after you turn it off.

> ðŸŒ¿ _Tip: Play it blind. Donâ€™t look up spoilers or guides. Let Hyrule surprise you the way it should._

----------

## 2. **Super Mario Odyssey**

**Pure, joyful invention.**

Mario has had countless adventures, but none quite like this. With his living hat, Cappy, he can possess enemies, vehicles, and even objects â€” turning a T-Rex into a stomping machine or a bullet bill into a high-speed ride.

Each kingdom is a theme park of ideas:  
a city inspired by New York, a dessert land made of cakes, a prehistoric island full of dinosaurs.

Itâ€™s colorful, clever, and endlessly fun.  
And whether youâ€™re 8 or 80, itâ€™s hard not to smile when Mario throws his hat with that little _boing_ sound.

----------

## 3. **Animal Crossing: New Horizons**

**A quiet escape, built your way.**

No timers. No pressure. Just an island, a few animal neighbors, and the freedom to build a life at your own pace.

Fish at dawn. Catch bugs. Design your dream home. Host a birthday party for a raccoon.

It sounds simple â€” and it is. But in a world that never slows down, _New Horizons_ offers something rare: peace.

It became a lifeline for so many during difficult times, and even now, it remains a gentle reminder that small joys matter.

----------

## 4. **Mario Kart 8 Deluxe**

**The ultimate party game.**

Fast, chaotic, and always fun, _Mario Kart 8 Deluxe_ is the go-to game for gatherings.

Whether youâ€™re racing with family, friends, or trying to reclaim your pride after a blue shell betrayal, it never gets old.

With smooth controls, gorgeous visuals, and nearly every track from the seriesâ€™ history, itâ€™s the most complete _Mario Kart_ ever made.

And with up to eight players in local wireless mode, it turns any living room into a race track.

----------

## 5. **Super Smash Bros. Ultimate**

**Every Nintendo hero â€” in one place.**

Imagine Pikachu fighting alongside Samus, or Inkling taking on Banjo & Kazooie.  
_Smash Bros. Ultimate_ brings together over 70 characters from across Nintendoâ€™s 40-year history â€” and even beyond.

Itâ€™s not just a fighting game. Itâ€™s a celebration.  
Every stage, every music track, every costume is a nod to a beloved franchise.

Solo modes offer depth. But the real magic happens when you pass a Joy-Con to a friend and chaos unfolds on screen.

----------

## 6. **Kirby and the Forgotten Land**

**Cute, bold, and surprisingly deep.**

Kirbyâ€™s first full 3D adventure could have played it safe. Instead, itâ€™s one of the most creative and charming platformers on the Switch.

Explore post-apocalyptic cities, inhale enemies, copy their powers â€” and yes, even **drive a car**.

The game balances lighthearted fun with moments of mystery and wonder.  
And as you uncover the secrets of this lost world, you start to care about what happens to Kirby and his new friend, Elfilin.

Itâ€™s sweet, smart, and full of surprises.

----------

## 7. **Metroid Dread**

**Tension, precision, and silence.**

Samus returns â€” alone, hunted, and on a planet crawling with deadly machines.

_Metroid Dread_ blends tight platforming, stealth, and pulse-pounding chases into a masterclass of atmosphere.

Youâ€™ll sprint through dark corridors, freeze when you hear footsteps behind you, and hold your breath during silent takedowns.

Itâ€™s not just a return to form for the series â€” itâ€™s a reinvention.  
And for fans of immersive, solitary adventures, itâ€™s unforgettable.

----------

## 8. **Fire Emblem: Three Houses**

**Strategy with soul.**

Youâ€™re not just a commander â€” youâ€™re a teacher.

At the Garreg Mach Monastery, you train students, eat lunch with them, and guide them through war and ideology. Then, you lead them into battle â€” where one wrong move can cost a life.

The story splits into three distinct paths, each with its own politics, characters, and moral weight.

Itâ€™s a deep tactical RPG, yes â€” but what stays with you are the relationships.  
The quiet moments. The losses. The choices that feel real.

----------

## 9. **Luigiâ€™s Mansion 3**

**Funny, spooky, and full of personality.**

Luigi, ever the reluctant hero, gets invited to a luxury hotel â€” only to find itâ€™s run by ghosts. And of course, Marioâ€™s been captured. Again.

With his Poltergust vacuum and trusty sidekick Polterpup, Luigi explores 17 floors, each with its own wild theme:  
a fitness center, a movie studio, a pool party floor gone wrong.

The puzzles are clever, the humor is spot-on, and the ghost-catching mechanics are satisfying.  
Itâ€™s spooky enough to feel adventurous, but never truly scary â€” just charmingly eerie.

----------

## 10. **The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom**

**Creativity as a superpower.**

If _Breath of the Wild_ taught us to explore, _Tears of the Kingdom_ teaches us to invent.

Now you can build vehicles, combine weapons, and manipulate time and gravity.  
Stick a wheel to a plank, add a fan, light a rocket â€” and suddenly, youâ€™re flying across the sky.

The world expands in every direction:  
floating islands above, a haunting underworld below, and Hyrule still thriving in between.

Itâ€™s not just a sequel. Itâ€™s a leap forward â€” for the series, and for what games can be.
